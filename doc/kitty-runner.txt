							   *kitty-runner.nvim*
This plugin allows to use kitty terminal as runner for commands.


						  *kitty-runner.open_runner()*
kitty-runner.open_runner({location})

    Open the runner (if it doesn't already exist) in {location}. {location} is an optional parameter. If not passed, it will use `config.runner.default_location`.
    Locations can be found here: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/#cmdoption-kitty-launch-location


					       *kitty-runner.send_to_runner()*
kitty-runner.send_to_runner({command}, {location})

    Send {command} to runner if the runner exists.  If the runner doesn't exist,
    it will create a runner instance in the specified {location} and send the command.
    Locations can be found here: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/#cmdoption-kitty-launch-location


						       *kitty-runner.launch()*
kitty-runner.launch({command}, {location})

    Launch {command} in the specified {location}. Unlike `send_to_runner()`, `launch()` doesn't create a runner instance.
